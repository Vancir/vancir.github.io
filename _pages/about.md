I am a first-year Ph.D. student at <a href='https://udel.edu'>University of Delaware</a>, advised by <a href="https://xgao-work.github.io">Prof. Gao Xing</a>. Before joining University of Delaware, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Xiamen University and Master's degree from the Pennsylvania State University. In addition, I worked at <a href="https://research.qianxin.com/">QI-ANXIN Technology Research Institute</a> for three years. My research interests include AI system security and software security.
